<h3>Evolution of Celestia's Icon</h3>
<p>The Celestia icon has evolved through three distinct eras, reflecting the software's journey toward astronomical realism. It began as a minimalist red moon orbiting a blue planet, a symbolic nod to its early mechanics. As the simulator matured across multiple platforms, these abstract shapes were replaced by a detailed rendering of Jupiter and Io. Finally, in 2016, the modern identity featuring the ringed majesty of Saturn was designed by FarGetaNik.</p>
