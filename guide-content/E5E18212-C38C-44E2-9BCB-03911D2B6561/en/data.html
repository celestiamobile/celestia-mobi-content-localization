<p>On September 4, 2024 a small meteoroid only about 1-m in diameter was discovered to be in a direct collision course with Earth. Designated by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) as <strong>2024 RW₁</strong>, it was first spotted by Jacqueline Fazekas of the Catalina Sky Survey from Mount Lemnon Observatory in Arizona, USA about 14 hours before impact.</p>
<br>
<p>It was the ninth known asteroid discovered on a collision course with Earth since 2008. The meteoroid crashed off the coast of the island of Luzon in the Philippines by 00:39 (UTC+8), and despite the stormy weather at the time caused by the departing Typhoon Yagi (Enteng) and the southwest monsoon, many astronomers, space enthusiasts and skywatchers in the country have managed to observe and record the event as it occurs</p>
