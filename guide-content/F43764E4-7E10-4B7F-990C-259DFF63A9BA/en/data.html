<p>On the second week of May 2024, a series of coronal mass ejections and solar flares originating from a large sunspot group called AR3663, struck the Earth as a powerful geomagnetic storm, with the strongest one so far erupting on May 10th. As a result, it generated aurorae as far south as Florida, USA and as far north as Australia. It is the first G5-class geomagnetic storm observed since 2003 and possibly the strongest one on record since March 1989</p>
