<h4 id="expand-content">How do I expand the content in Celestia?</h4>
<p>Celestia has support for add-ons. Add-ons are content created by the community to enrich the content in Celestia. You can find out about where to find and how to use add-ons in <a href="celguide://guide?guide=D1A96BFA-00BB-0089-F361-10DD886C8A4F">Use Add-ons and Scripts</a>.</p>
<h4 id="modify-configuration">How do I modify Celestia's configuration or data?</h4>
<p>You cannot directly modify Celestia's default celestia.cfg file or the default data directory because modern versions of Celestia's application package directory is not writable. However, you can follow <a href="celguide://guide?guide=CA57806B-690B-CE4C-2173-B0B6079544FF">Override Data Directory to Read from</a> to tell Celestia to boot with your custom celestia.cfg/data folder instead of the default one.</p>
<h4 id="create-addons">I want to create my own add-ons, how do I get started?</h4>
<p>Check out <a href="https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Celestia#Addon_Tutorials_for_Beginners">Addon Tutorials for Beginners</a> on Wikibooks for making add-ons from scratch. Please also read <a href="celguide://guide?guide=D1A96BFA-00BB-0089-F361-10DD886C8A4F">Use Add-ons and Scripts</a> to find out where to put your newly created add-ons.</p>
<h4 id="download-all-addons">I want to download all available add-ons from celestia.mobi, how do I achieve that?</h4>
<p>Celestia does not offer a way to download multiple add-ons and we don't think you should try to do that either.<br>Some add-ons can have conflicts with other add-ons and can prevent Celestia from starting up or behaving correctly. Having too many add-ons also will slow down Celestia significantly.</p>
<h4 id="report-errors">There are errors in Celestia data or with the app itself, how do I report these errors?</h4>
<p>If you notice errors with an add-on, you can make an issue in <a href="https://github.com/celestiamobile/celestia-addon-validator/issues">celestiamobile/celestia-addon-validator</a>.<br>
If it is an error with the data that comes with Celestia, not from add-ons, please post an issue in <a href="https://github.com/CelestiaProject/CelestiaContent/issues">CelestiaProject/CelestiaContent</a>.<br>
If you want to report an issue with Celestia program, you can report the issue from inside the app in "Send Feedback" → "Report a Bug" or "Help" → "Report a Bug".</p>
<h4 id="missing-objects">I can't find a certain astronomical object in Celestia. Why is that?</h4>
<p>Celestia app's data is not up to date and that's usually why you can't find an object that appears on news. The community might have created add-ons for the object you are looking for, so you can browse the online add-ons to see if that is the case. Additionally Celestia's search feature only searches stars, DSOs, and objects in the nearest system, you might have to travel to the system of the object first.</p>
<h4 id="android-addon-folder">I'm on Android 11 or later, how do I access the add-on folder?</h4>
<p>By default, add-ons are installed to Android/data and Android 11 makes it hard for file managers to access the content under Android/data. However, Celestia (1.7.8 or later) has support for using Android/media folder as the default folder for add-ons.<br>
To change the default folder used for add-ons, please go to "Settings" → "Data Location" and choose "Migrate Add-on Data". Be sure to create a backup before migrating your data to avoid data loss.</p>
<h4 id="change-language">How do I change the display language of Celestia?</h4>
<p>By default, Celestia uses the system language as the display language. If you want to use a different language, for Android/Windows, you can change it in Settings. On systems that support per app language setting (Android 13 and later, iOS, and macOS), you can go to system settings to change the display language for Celestia. You usually need to relaunch Celestia for the change to take effect.</p>
<h4 id="virtual-display-casting">How does virtual display (casting) work on Android?</h4>
<p>With version 1.9.8 or later, Celestia supports displaying on a physical external display as well as a virtual display. A virtual display is a display that is not connected to the device, but is instead created by the system. This is useful for casting the display to a TV or projector. However, due to how casting is implemented by various vendors, Celestia might not work as expected on all devices and displaying on virtual display is disabled by default. You can enable it in Settings. <br>If you are using Google Cast, there is an issue in GMS Cast Receiver that causes invalid virtual displays to be presented to Celestia to cast to. To ensure that casting works reliably, be sure to start casting before launching Celestia. If you disconnected the cast session, you might need to reboot the Android system to ensure that invalid virtual displays are cleaned up.</p>
