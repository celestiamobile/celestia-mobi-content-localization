<p>On 19–20 August 2024, the European Space Agency's <strong><i>Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer</i></strong> (<strong><i>JUICE</i></strong>) spacecraft flew past both the Earth and the Moon! Launched in April 2023, the flybys were the first of four planned planetary encounters in order for the mission to gain enough delta-v to reach Jupiter and its moons. JUICE is expected to arrive at Jupiter on July 2031, and will study the planet and its moons concurrently with NASA's <i>Europa Clipper</i> mission</p>
