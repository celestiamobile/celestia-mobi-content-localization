<p>Around 22:40 JST (13:40 UTC) of 23 August 2024, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has officially terminated operations of the <strong><i>Smart Lander for Investigating Moon</i> (SLIM)</strong> mission when it failed to reestablish contact with the probe, three months since its last known transmission with Earth (April 28th)</p>
<br>
<p>Launched alongside the XRISM observatory in 6 September 2023, it took more than three months for the probe to arrive on lunar orbit. It made its landing attempt on 19 January 2024 near Shioli Crater, making Japan the fifth country to successfully land on the Moon. Although designed to survive for only one lunar day (14 days), it continued to send back data to Earth for another three months (April 28th) until the spacecraft eventually failed due to the harsh environment of the lunar surface.</p>
