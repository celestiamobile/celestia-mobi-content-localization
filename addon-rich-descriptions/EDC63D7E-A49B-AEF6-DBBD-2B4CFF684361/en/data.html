<p>Dawn is a NASA spacecraft designed to study two of the three known protoplanets in the asteroid belt, <a href="celaddon://item?item=20E27C97-EF70-A424-A05A-6743529A0946">Ceres</a> and <a href="celaddon://item?item=610C57F5-872F-52BC-DD23-954A44D4001D">Vesta</a>. It is the first spacecraft to orbit two extraterrestrial bodies, which is made possible by its use of ion propulsion. During its nine-year mission (2007-2018), it orbited Vesta from 2011-2012 and then orbited Ceres in 2015, which remains so to this day until its predicted crash sometime in 2044.</p>
