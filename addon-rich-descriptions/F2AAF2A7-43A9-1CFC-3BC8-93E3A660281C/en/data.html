<p>223 Rosa is a large 87.61 km-wide main-belt asteroid belonging to the Themis family. It is classified as a C/P-type asteroid, which is probably composed of carbonaceous material rich in water ice. Initially, a flyby of this asteroid was proposed for ESA's <a href="celaddon://item?item=13D974FA-19C2-9460-C628-A292E83A8BA8">JUICE</a>Â mission, which if approved, would take place in 2029-Oct-15. It was later decided not to perform this flyby, to maximize fuel for the main mission in the Jupiter system.</p>
