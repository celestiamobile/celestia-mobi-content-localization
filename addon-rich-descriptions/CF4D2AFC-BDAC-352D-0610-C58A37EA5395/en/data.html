<p>1998 KY₂₆ is an X-type near-Earth asteroid only 30 m in diameter. A member of the Apollo group, it orbits the Sun once every 500 days, and rotates on its axis once every 10.7 minutes. In September 2020, the asteroid was targeted for future exploration during the extended mission of JAXA's <a href="celaddon://item?item=133C0733-1699-7F0E-C7E5-AB2A2AC174B2">Hayabusa2</a> probe, which it will encounter on July 2031. As a result of this selection, 1998 KY₂₆ will become the smallest object ever visited by a spacecraft up close.</p>
