<p><p>1998 KY₂₆ is an X-type near-Earth asteroid only 30 m in diameter. A member of the Apollo group, it orbits the Sun once every 500 days, and rotates on its axis once every 10.7 minutes.</p>
<br>
<p>In September 2020, the asteroid was targeted for future exploration during the extended mission of JAXA's <a href="celaddon://item?item=133C0733-1699-7F0E-C7E5-AB2A2AC174B2">Hayabusa2</a> probe, which it will encounter on July 2031. As a result of this selection, 1998 KY₂₆ will become the smallest object ever visited by a spacecraft up close</p></p>
