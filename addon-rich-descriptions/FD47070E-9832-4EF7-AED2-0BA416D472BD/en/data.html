<p>The <strong>USS Franklin</strong> (<strong>NX-326</strong>) is a <i>Freedom</i>-class Federation starship built in the late 2140s. It was the first Earth ship capable of reaching Warp 4, and it was commanded by Capt. Balthazar Edison until it disappeared in 2164. In the alternate reality, it was discovered to have crash-landed on <strong>Altamid</strong> and is later used by the crew of the fallen <a href="celaddon://item?item=E95F2F4B-905A-4CFA-94F7-811284189A95">USS Enterprise</a> to escape the planet and prevent Krall (formerly Edison) from destroying Yorktown Base and the Federation as a whole</p>
