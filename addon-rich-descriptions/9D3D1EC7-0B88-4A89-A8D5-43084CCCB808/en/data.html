<p><strong>Gamma Pavonis</strong> is a relatively old star home to three planets. Its primary planet, <strong>Chinook</strong>, was found to be a former Earth-like world now transformed into a lifeless global desert. Despite this, humanity managed to establish colonies along its remaining seas, supplied by ice from the moons of its neighboring gas giants.</p>
