<p><strong>ASC-1</strong> to <strong>3</strong> were three communications satellites operated by the American Satellite Corp. and later PanAmSat launched between 1985 and 1991. The first satellite is one of three spacecraft deployed from the payload bay of <strong>STS-51-I (Discovery)</strong>. They provided television broadcasting and network until 2006, when the last of the satellites were decommissioned and replaced by newer fleets</p>
<p>NOTES:<ul><li>Orbital data for all three satellites were retrieved from CelesTrak</li><li>The satellite ASC-1 requires the Space Shuttle add-on installed first to be viewed.</li><li>Shuttle missions modified by this add-on: STS-51-I</li></ul></p>
