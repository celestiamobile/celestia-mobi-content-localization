<p>This addon updates the models and formats of various irregular natural satellites (moons) of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune for a more interesting view.</p>
<p></p><aside class="aside-container note"><p class="label">Note</p><p>All models and shapes of this addon (except Saturn's moon Ymir, which had the shape studied through light curve) are fictitious, as their true shapes are not known. Irregular moons with well-known shapes already exist originally on Celestia.</p></aside><p></p>
