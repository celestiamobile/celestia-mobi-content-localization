<p>This add-on adds XYZV trajectories in the period 1957-2100 for the 10 known (as of 2026) irregular outer satellites of Uranus. These satellites undergo gravitational perturbations, primarily from the Sun, which change their respective orbital elements. With this add-on, they are precisely simulated, which is not possible with simple default Keplerian orbits.</p>
