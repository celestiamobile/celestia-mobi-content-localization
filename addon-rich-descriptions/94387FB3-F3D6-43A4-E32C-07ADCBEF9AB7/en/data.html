<p>The third spacecraft under the New Frontiers program, OSIRIS-REx is a NASA asteroid mission launched in 2016 to retrieve 60-2000 g of material from asteroid 101955 Bennu. It reached the asteroid in late 2018, and made its sample collection in 2020. It is expected to return to Earth on 2023, and afterwards will go to the asteroid 99942 Apophis by 2029</p>
