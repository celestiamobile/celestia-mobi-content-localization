<p>In the movie 2001 "A Space Odyssey," the Earth, as seen from space, is different from the real photos. That is because, in 1968, when the film was directed by the great Stanley Kubrick, the only photos of the Earth from space are in grayscale. Only when the Apollo 11 mission took the first Earth color photos, was the Earth seen in true color.</p>
