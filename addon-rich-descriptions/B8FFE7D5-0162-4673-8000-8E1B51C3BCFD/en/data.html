<p><strong>PSR J0737-3039</strong> is the first known double pulsar ever discovered. Located around 3,588 light-years away in the constellation Puppis, it is the only binary neutron star system known (as of 2024) where both component stars are pulsars. Both pulsars orbit each other once every 2.45 hours and is expected to merge in a powerful kilonova event in the next 85 million years</p>
