<p>The <strong>Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON)</strong>, also known as <strong>Explorer 96</strong>, is a NASA science satellite designed to study the changes within the Earth's ionosphere, and its interaction with solar activity. It was launched to LEO on October 2019, and operated for three years until it abruptly lost contact in 2022. Its mission was declared over in 2024, and is now currently a derelict space debris in orbit above the Earth.</p>
