<p>This addon adds, as an alternative texture, a 4K map for Mars based on data from the <a href="celaddon://item?item=71C68D4E-CA59-5EC2-06E2-3888702C59D0">Mariner 4</a> (1965) and <a href="celaddon://item?item=134D2FC1-502D-D8C6-2090-DC60DB474F5E">Mariner 6 and 7</a> (1969) missions. The coverage of the north polar region is based on ground-based observations, since it was not imaged by the Mariner flyby missions.</p>
