<p>HD 80606 is a Sun-like star about 217 light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. A gas giant revolves around in a very eccentric orbit that takes the planet as far away as 0.86 AU to as close as 5 million km from the star's photosphere. This addon includes a semi-fictional data that's based on computer simulation of HD 80606 b (see below) as well as an older fictional texture as an alternate surface.</p>
