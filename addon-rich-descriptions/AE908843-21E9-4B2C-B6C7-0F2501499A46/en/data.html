<p><strong>OGLE-2013-BLG-0341L</strong> is a distant binary star system of two red dwarf stars about 2,971 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. An Earth-sized rocky planet was discovered orbiting the secondary star in the system, and although its distance is comparable to that of Venus to the Sun, its temperature is much more similar to Titan instead.</p>
