<p><strong>Messier 16</strong>, also known as <strong>NGC 6611</strong> and the <strong>Eagle Nebula</strong>, is a young open cluster of stars about 5,564 light-years away in the constellation Serpens. Its most famous feature is the Pillars of Creation, the dark silhouette near the center of the nebula, after <a href="celaddon://item?item=9368F0C1-BF71-FA3D-A521-A13AAA5B84E7">Hubble</a> took images of it in 1995</p>
<p>NOTE: This add-on might not work in low-end devices due to many sprite models used to render the entire nebula for Celestia<p><p><img class="full-width-image" src="{0}"></p>
