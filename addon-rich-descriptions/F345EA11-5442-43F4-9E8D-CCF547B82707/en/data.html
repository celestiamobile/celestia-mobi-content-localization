<p>Sierra Space's <strong>Dream Chaser</strong> is a reusable lifting-body spaceplane that was originally intended to carry a seven-person crew and later cargo to and from the <a href="celaddon://item?item=DB2CB6F5-247F-761C-4001-072A6C6BE5FD">International Space Station</a>. Delays in development has resulted in its first spaceflight to be reconfigured into a free-flying orbital test mission by late 2026 instead, however the option remains open for potential future cargo missions to the station itself.</p>
