<p><strong>Prospero (X-3)</strong> is a small satellite that became the first and only spacecraft sent into orbit by a British rocket. It undertook several cosmic experiments between 1971 and 1973, however it remained active until 2004. It is predicted to reenter the atmosphere by 2070, though plans to retrieve it safely are being pursued by Skyrora since 2021</p>
