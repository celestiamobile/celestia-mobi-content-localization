<p><strong>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)</strong> is a NASA mission designed to study the geology and climate of Mars, provide reconnaissance of future landing sites, and relay data from surface missions back to Earth. It has been orbiting the Red Planet since March 2006, and has continued to operate far beyond its intended design life. Due to its critical role as a high-speed data-relay for ground missions, NASA intends to continue the mission as long as possible, at least through the late 2020s</p>
