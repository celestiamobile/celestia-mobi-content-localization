<p><strong>Deep Impact</strong> was a NASA mission designed to study the interior of Comet Tempel 1 by releasing an impactor into the comet, of which it struck at high velocity on 2005-Jul-4. Afterwards, it was sent on an extended mission to Comet Boethin, which later redirected to Comet Hartley 2 in 2010 after the former target was declared lost. It was scheduled to visit the asteroid (163249) 2002 GT in 2020, but the probe abruptly lost contact with Earth in 2013</p>
