<p><strong>Kepler-61</strong>, aka <strong>KOI-1361</strong>, is a binary star system consisting of a K-type main sequence star and a red dwarf located about 1,103 light-years in the constellation Cygnus. A single temperate mini-Neptune possibly on a eccentric orbit that was once thought to be a potentially habitable super-Earth is found orbiting the larger star in the system</p>
