<p>HD 82943, also known as 164 G. Hydrae, is a yellow dwarf star approximately 89 light-years away in the constellation of Hydra. Two extrasolar planets have been confirmed to be orbiting it, confirmed in 2000 and 2001 respectively, and it is thought that the system had more giant planets that were "swallowed" by the parent star. A third planet was proposed in 2004, but to this day it is still unconfirmed.</p>
