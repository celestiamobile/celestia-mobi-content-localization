<p>The <strong>Augmented Target Docking Adapter (ATDA)</strong> was developed as a backup target spacecraft in the wake of the launch failure of the third <a href="celaddon://item?item=A2A28500-BFEC-4A58-ACDE-D8FF1EDB9E2A">GATV</a> mission for Gemini 9. It was launched on June 1966 and successfully rendezvoused with Gemini 9A, however no docking attempt was made due to its failed fairing deployment, earning the nickname "<i>The Angry Alligator</i>" by the astronauts</p>
