<p><strong>Salyut 3</strong>, also known secretly as <i>Almaz 2</i>, was a Soviet space station in orbit for only 7 months between 1974 and 1975. Together with its ill-fated sibling, Salyut 2 (which was destroyed by orbital debris), they were designed as manned spy satellites for the Soviet military. Salyut 3 is notable for being the only known spacecraft to carry an onboard gun. It was only visited once by a cosmonaut crew. Both Salyut 2 and Salyut 3 are the third and fifth space stations launched as part of the Salyut series</p>
