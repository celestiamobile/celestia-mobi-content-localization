<p><strong>Lunar Trailblazer</strong> was a small, low-cost NASA mission intended to detect and map water on the lunar surface, helping understand its formation and distribution. Launched alongside <a href="celaddon://item?item=85562E75-599C-45FB-AA91-8D28E47C9137">IM-2 (<i>Athena</i>)</a> on 27 February 2025, it unfortunately lost contact just 11 hours after launch. All recovery efforts failed, and by the time of its lunar flyby on 2 March 2025, the mission was essentially declared over. The spacecraft is now abandoned in solar orbit thereafter.</p>
