<p><strong>97P/Metcalf–Brewington</strong> is a 3.4-km wide Jupiter-family comet currently with a 10.4-year orbit around the Sun. It was first discovered by Joel H. Metcalf in 1906, becoming a lost comet until recovered by Howard J. Brewington in 1991. A close encounter with Jupiter in 1993 resulted in its orbit to increase its perihelion distance from 1.59 to 2.61 AU</p>
