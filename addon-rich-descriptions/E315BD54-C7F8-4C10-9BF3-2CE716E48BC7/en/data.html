<p>While TOI-2076 doesn't possess any notable multiplanetary resonate chains, it could have an alternating 2:1, 5:3 resonance pattern if a planet at 6 Days is present within this system. A signal was found within TESS data that is consistent with a super-Earth sized object at roughly 6.25 Days but the signal could not be validated as confirmed.</p>
