<p>KOI-4878 is a Sun-like star about 1,134 light-years away in the constellation Draco. In 2015, a planetary signature was detected in the star's habitable zone, in addition to having the same stellar distance and size to Earth. If its existence is confirmed, then this planet will become one of the most Earth-like potentially habitable planets ever discovered</p>
