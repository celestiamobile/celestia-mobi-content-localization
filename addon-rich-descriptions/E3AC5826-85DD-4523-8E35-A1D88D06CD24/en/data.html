<p>HR 4796 is a binary star system of a young A-type main sequence star and a red dwarf about 230.25 light-years away in the constellation Centaurus. In 1991, infrared observations of the system revealed that the larger primary star (component A) is surrounded by a dense protoplanetary disk, which was subsequently been studied using the <a href="celaddon://item?item=9368F0C1-BF71-FA3D-A521-A13AAA5B84E7">Hubble</a> and <a href="celaddon://item?item=496D0045-F819-C7F7-A3BA-1ADE6ED60F9A">Spitzer</a> observatories from 2007 to 2018</p>
