<p>2020 CD3 is a small near-Earth asteroid approximately 2 meters in diameter, discovered on 2020-Feb-25. Given its heliocentric orbit similar to Earth's, temporary captures can occasionally occur, as happened between 2017 and 2020. After several orbits around Earth and solar and lunar perturbations, the temporary "mini-moon" returned to its heliocentric orbit in May 2020.</p>
