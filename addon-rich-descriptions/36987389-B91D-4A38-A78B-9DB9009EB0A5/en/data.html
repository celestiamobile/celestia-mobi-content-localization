<p><strong>P/2019 LD₂ (ATLAS)</strong> is a Jupiter-family comet/centaur discovered by the <i>Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System</i> (ATLAS) in June 2019. Initially thought to be the first known Jupiter trojan with cometary activity, it was later determined that its orbit is unstable due to frequent gravitational encounters with Jupiter, three of which occurred between 2017 and 2063. Its nucleus is estimated to be about 2.4 km in diameter.</p>
