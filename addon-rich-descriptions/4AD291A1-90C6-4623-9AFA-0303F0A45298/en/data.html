<p>The <strong>Axiom Space Station (AxS)</strong>, also known as the <strong>Axiom Orbital Segment</strong>, are a number of planned future components of the <a href="celaddon://item?item=DB2CB6F5-247F-761C-4001-072A6C6BE5FD">International Space Station</a> starting late 2025. Three modules will be initially attached on the front berthing port of the <i>Harmony</i> module, then it will eventually be separated shortly before the ISS is decommissioned sometime before 2031, thus becoming a new independent space station in its own right. Crew and cargo are expected to arrive and depart via <a href="celaddon://item?item=EAE294B1-E335-4D49-8E5A-917067EE1B56">SpaceX Dragon 2</a> capsules</p>
