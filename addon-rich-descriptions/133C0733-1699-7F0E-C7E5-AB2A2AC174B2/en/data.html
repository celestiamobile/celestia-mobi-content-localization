<p><p>Hayabusa 2 is a JAXA sample-return mission launched to the asteroid 162173 Ryugu on 2014-Dec-3. It arrived on Ryugu in 2018-Dec-31 and collected samples from the asteroid twice in the following year. During its two year stay at Ryugu, it deployed three MINERVA-II "rovers" and the MASCOT hopper, before returning to Earth on 2020-Dec-6.</p>
<br>
<p>It is now on its extended mission to study two asteroids, 2001 CC₂₁ and 1998 KY₂₆, on two subsequent encounters on 2026 and 2031 respectively</p></p>
