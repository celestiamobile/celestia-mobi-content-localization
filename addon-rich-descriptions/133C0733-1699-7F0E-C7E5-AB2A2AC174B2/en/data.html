<p><p>Hayabusa 2 is a JAXA sample-return mission launched to the asteroid 162173 Ryugu on 2014-Dec-3. It arrived on Ryugu in 2018-Dec-31 and collected samples from the asteroid twice in the following year. During its two year stay at Ryugu, it deployed three MINERVA-II "rovers" and the MASCOT hopper, before returning to Earth on 2020-Dec-6.</p>
<br>
<p>It is now on its extended mission to study two asteroids, 2001 CC₂₁ and 1998 KY₂₆, on two subsequent encounters on 2026 and 2031 respectively</p></p>
<p>NOTES:<ul><li>Hayabusa2's primary mission from 2014 to 2019 requires the asteroid <a href="celaddon://item?item=09016A28-FD59-495A-B38B-E4003789E2AF">162173 Ryugu</a> installed first on Celestia</li><li>For the two asteroid flybys on its extended mission on 2026 and 2031, download the asteroids named <a href="celaddon://item?item=FB78582B-13D6-F55E-4862-85EAD1D50E49">98943 (2001 CC₂₁)</a> and <a href="celaddon://item?item=CF4D2AFC-BDAC-352D-0610-C58A37EA5395">(1998 KY₂₆)</a></li><li>Due to currently limited trajectory data, the actual flyby of 1998 KY₂₆ will not (yet) occur, but the last known orbital data enables the spacecraft to at least share a common orbit with the asteroid around the Sun</li></ul></p>
