<p><strong>Landsat 1 to 3</strong> were the first-generation of Earth observations satellites operated by NASA and the USGS. Launched between 1972 and 1978, their design were based on the Nimbus weather satellites. The Landsats began the first continuous mapping of the Earth's surface. All the first-generation satellites were retired from active service since 1983</p>
