<p>Europa Clipper is a NASA interplanetary mission designed to study Europa in a series of 53 flybys while in orbit around Jupiter. Planned to launch in 2024, it will arrive on Jupiter and its moons by 2030 and will study the system until it is deliberately sent to crash onto Ganymede at the end of its mission on 2034</p>
