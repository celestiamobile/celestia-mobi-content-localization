<p><strong>450P/LONEOS</strong> is a 7-km wide periodic comet with a 22-year orbit around the Sun (as of 2022). Discovered in 2004, it was formerly a centaur until a close encounter with Saturn in 1992 significantly decreased its semi-major axis by 5.2 AU, which began its transition into a Jupiter-family comet in the next few centuries.</p>
