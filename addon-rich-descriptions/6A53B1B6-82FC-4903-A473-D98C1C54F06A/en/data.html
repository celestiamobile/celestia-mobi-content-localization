<p>2024 YR4 is a NEO, Apollo-type asteroid, discovered on 2024-Dec-27. It initially had a considerable chance of colliding with Earth in 2032-Dec-22, when it reached level 3 on the Torino scale (1-in-32 in 2025-Feb-18). However, subsequent observations have reduced the risk of an Earth impact to effectively zero. However, it still has a 1-in-58 chance of colliding with the Moon. Due to the large uncertainties, additional observations will still be needed to further refine its orbit. 2024 YR4 is about 60 meters in diameter, and light curves indicate that it has an elongated shape and a fast rotation period of only 19.5 minutes.</p>
