<p>Vega is a young A-type main-sequence star about 25 light-years away in the constellation Lyra. It is the fifth brightest star in the naked eye. In 1983, infrared analysis of the star determined that it contains a protoplanetary disk, one of the first stars detected to contain such structures, however it wasn't confirmed to exist until 2005. In addition, a planet was detected orbiting the star in 2021, but its existence is yet to be confirmed by follow-up studies</p>
