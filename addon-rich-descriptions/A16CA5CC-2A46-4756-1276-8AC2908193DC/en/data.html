<p>Kepler-438 Ab is an exoplanet similar in size to Earth, orbiting the red dwarf Kepler-438 A at a distance of 472.9 light-years from Earth. It was discovered by the Kepler space telescope on January 6, 2015. Kepler-438 Ab orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star, where it could have liquid water on its surface. Therefore, this planet is subject to a powerful radiation activity from its star every 100 days, due to immense solar flares, which would prevent life from developing on the planet.</p>
