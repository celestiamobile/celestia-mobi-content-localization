<p>The <strong>Proton (N-4)</strong> were a series of Soviet scientific satellites designed to study cosmic rays and charged particles in space. Weighing around 12.2 tons, a total of four satellites were launched between 1965 and 1966, only three were successful. They were the very first payloads of the UR-500 rocket, which would be later renamed after the satellites themselves.</p>
