<p><strong>Suisei</strong>, also known as <strong>PLANET-A</strong>, is the second of two Japanese space probes sent to flyby <a href="celaddon://item?item=3DCF1DB4-7CDC-436C-80E6-056D30D0DEF1">Halley's Comet</a> on March 1986. Part of an international fleet called the <strong><i>Halley Armada</i></strong>, it is physically identical with <a href="celaddon://item?item=EC93C11E-94CD-4EFE-92E9-A3A40EE3B39F">Sakigake</a>, albeit with different onboard instruments. After encountering Halley, it went on to visit two other comets, but was cancelled after exhausting its fuel supply in 1991.</p>
