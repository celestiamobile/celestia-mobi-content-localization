<p><strong>2023 KQ₁₄</strong> is a distant trans-Neptunian object with an extremely wide orbit around the Sun. Estimated to be around 220–380 km in diameter, it is the fourth sednoid discovered so far, although its direction of aphelion is different from that of <a href="celaddon://item?item=2755EF55-C90D-8747-1026-7DC01E54D569">Sedna</a>, <a href="celaddon://item?item=CD68E45F-A230-44A2-AE53-EDE2A6B22D9B">2012 VP₁₁₃</a>, or Leleākūhonua, possibly indicating that the hypothetical <a href="celaddon://item?item=8C2DE41B-5D8D-710F-547A-3C6F774CDEB4">Planet Nine</a> may not be the one influencing their extreme present orbits. It was nicknamed "<strong>Ammonite</strong>" by its discovery team.</p>
