<p><strong>Landsat 4 to 5</strong> were the second-generation of Earth observation satellites operated by NASA and the USGS. They were built using the <i>Multimission Modular Spacecraft</i> (MMS) bus, which were originally intended with <a href="celaddon://item?item=1D93EA6F-8FC4-A477-7660-B6B343BB8E61">Shuttle servicing missions</a> in mind. Both satellites were launched in 1982 and 1984, remaining in active service until 2001 and 2013 respectively.</p>
