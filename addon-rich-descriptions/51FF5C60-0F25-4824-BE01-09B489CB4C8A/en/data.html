<p>The <strong>Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO)</strong> was a NASA mission designed to study the Martian climate, atmosphere and surface changes in orbit. It was part of the <strong><i>Mars Surveyor '98</i></strong> mission alongside <a href="celaddon://item?item=3C317F2D-A901-286F-4A07-0F679ED45D2B">Mars Polar Lander</a>, however it was unintentionally destroyed about 57 km above the Martian atmosphere due to its onboard computer being unable to convert metric and imperial units during orbital insertion</p>
