<p><strong>Gliese 229</strong> is a nearby triple star system of a red dwarf star and two brown dwarfs about 18.79 light-years away in the constellation Lepus. In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stu358">2014</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4365/ab5e7c">2020</a>, radial velocity signals reported the detection of two mini-neptunes orbiting the primary star (A). However, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ad92f9">follow-up studies in 2025</a> failed to verify their existence, with the signals most likely generated by stellar activity instead</p>
