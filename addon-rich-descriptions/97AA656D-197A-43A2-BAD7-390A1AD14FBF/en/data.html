<p>This add-on adds a 4K texture for Uranus, based in part on <a href="celaddon://item?item=7EC33280-6523-8F01-FB57-AB000C1000DB">Voyager 2</a> coverage in 1986. It also adds the faint outer rings Mu and Nu, discovered by <a href="celaddon://item?item=9368F0C1-BF71-FA3D-A521-A13AAA5B84E7">Hubble</a> observations between 2003-2005, as well as the broad, inner and also faint ring Zeta/1986U2R, first seen by Voyager. Lastly, it includes five additional "Locations" in the rings.</p>
<p></p><aside class="aside-container important"><p class="label">Important</p><p>Since the Mu/Nu/Zeta rings are extremely faint, it is recommended that you increase the ambient light in Celestia's settings. Even then, some effort is required to see them clearly.</p></aside><p></p><p><img class="full-width-image" src="{0}"><i class="text-secondary-size text-secondary-color">Uranus in 1986, as seen by Voyager 2.
