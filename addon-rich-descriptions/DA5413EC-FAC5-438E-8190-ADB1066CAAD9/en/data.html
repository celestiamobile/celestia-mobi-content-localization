<p><strong>Kepler-1513</strong>, also known as <strong>KOI-3678</strong>, is a binary star system consisting of a K-type main sequence star and a red dwarf about 1,147 light-years away in the constellation Lyra. In 2022, studies of the transit-timing variations of component A's one known planet suggested the existence of a subterran-mass satellite, making it potentially the third strong candidate exomoon detected so far (after <a href="celaddon://item?item=999C0059-DBC6-F763-E5E4-8E5F41F80450">Kepler-1625</a> and <a href="celaddon://item?item=5018AB8D-5C3F-C380-895A-EBAEABC6EE9A">Kepler-1708</a>). However, follow-up studies rule out this possibility in 2023, attributing it to an unconfirmed second gas giant planet instead.</p>
