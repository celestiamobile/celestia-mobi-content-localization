<p><strong>Explorer 6</strong>, also known as <strong>S-2</strong>, was an early NASA satellite that studied the space environment around Earth. Launched in August 1959, it took the very first photograph of Earth in orbit as an experiment that later led to the development of weather satellites. It remained operational until October 1959 and reentered the atmosphere by July 1961</p>
