<p>81P/Wild, also known as Wild 2, is currently a periodic comet with an orbital period of 6.4 years. It was a former Halley-type comet until an encounter with Jupiter in 1974 reduced its orbital period from 43 years to about 6 years. It was the primary target of NASA's <a href="celaddon://item?item=35F57A39-2071-2665-771D-DE9EDF6685B2">Stardust</a> mission, which performed a flyby of the comet in January 2004 to collect samples from the coma, which were returned to Earth two years later.</p>
