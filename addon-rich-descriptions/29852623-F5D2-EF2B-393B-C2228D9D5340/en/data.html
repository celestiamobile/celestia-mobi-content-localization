<p>Venera 9 to 14 were a series of Soviet spacecraft that successfully landed and collected data directly on the surface of Venus from 1975 to 1983. They all comprise of two main parts, the main spacecraft bus and the landers themselves. The first two missions saw their main buses orbit Venus, while the latter four missions conducted a flyby, all of which sent landers to different locations of Venus, of which they operated on the hostile surface for only 1-2 hours at most.</p>
