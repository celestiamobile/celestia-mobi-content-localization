<p>The <strong>Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST)</strong> is a NASA infrared observatory currently planned for launch by October 2026 or May 2027. Originally planned as a spy satellite before being donated to NASA in 2012, it has a mirror similar in size and design with that of <a href="celaddon://item?item=9368F0C1-BF71-FA3D-A521-A13AAA5B84E7">Hubble</a>, yet with a wider field-of-view. Data gathered by NGRST is expected to eventually complement the findings of <a href="celaddon://item?item=6D100C19-C902-3BCF-E9DC-81621177663D">JWST</a> as it arrives on the Sun-Earth Lagrange (L2) point about six months after launch.</p>
