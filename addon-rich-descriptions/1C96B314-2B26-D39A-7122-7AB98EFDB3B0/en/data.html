<p><strong>396P/Leonard</strong> is one of many comets discovered by Gregory J. Leonard. In May 1936, a very close encounter with Saturn (970,000 km) had significantly reduced its orbit from that of a centaur into a transitional Jupiter-family comet, triggering cometary activity that enabled it to be discovered in 2020. Its actual size and composition are currently unknown.</p>
