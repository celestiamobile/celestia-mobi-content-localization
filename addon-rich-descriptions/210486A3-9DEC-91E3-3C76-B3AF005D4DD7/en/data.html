<p><strong>449P/Leonard</strong> is one of many comets discovered by Gregory J. Leonard. A periodic comet with a 6.82-year orbit around the Sun, it was later found out by Maik Meyer that it was a previously lost comet that was first seen by Robert McNaught and Malcolm Hartley by accident in 1987. It is one of the most recent recovered astronomical objects to date.</p>
