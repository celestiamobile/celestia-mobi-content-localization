<p>9969 Braille is a Mars-crossing asteroid about 2.1 km in diameter. It was visited by the Deep Space 1 probe in July 1999 at a distance of 26 km, but an unfortunate failure of its instruments during the encounter prevented the probe from taking high-resolution images of its elongated surface.</p>
