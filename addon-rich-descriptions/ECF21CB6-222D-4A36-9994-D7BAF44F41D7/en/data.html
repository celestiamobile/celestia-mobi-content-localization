<p>9P/Tempel (Tempel 1) is a Jupiter-family comet measuring 7.6 km in diameter. In 2005, NASA's <a href="celaddon://item?item=F330BDCE-C7C5-73EC-6F5B-F58EB1CB9C96">Deep Impact</a> mission sent a component that deliberately struck the comet's nucleus in order to study its interior. The aftermath of the impact was later studied by the <a href="celaddon://item?item=35F57A39-2071-2665-771D-DE9EDF6685B2">Stardust</a> mission in 2011, making it the only comet visited twice in different occasions.</p>
