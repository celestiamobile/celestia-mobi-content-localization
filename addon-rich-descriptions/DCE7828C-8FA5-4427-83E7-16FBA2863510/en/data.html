<p>The <strong>Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) 1</strong>, also called <strong>Daichi</strong>, was an Earth observations satellite operated by JAXA from 2006 to 2011. Weighing over 3,810 kg at launch, it has three sensors designed for cartography and disaster monitoring across the Asia-Pacific region. A malfunction in its solar array led to the termination of the mission, shortly after it monitored the devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. It remains in LEO as derelict space debris (as of 2025)</p>
