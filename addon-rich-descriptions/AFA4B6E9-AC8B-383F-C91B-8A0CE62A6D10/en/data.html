<p>To see it, you have to go in the Time/Reset Time and set the year 2998.<br>This add-on shows relative fantasy space rendering, not the real Earth image.</p>
<p>Some facts about the three texture map of this add-on:
  <ul>
    <li>The Earth surface map shows the consequences of the greenhouse effect: entire countries, important cities (like Venice or new York) under meters of water.</li>
    <li>The Earth Night map shows a probable but fictional future aspect of the night side: very big cities, but recent:after the ice caps disasters, a very large number of cities will be rebuilt.</li>
    <li>The cloud map, based on the Stormy Earth add-on, shows the consequences of the pollution: a very big CO2-H2O cloud cap, like Venus, but a bit smaller.</li>
  </ul>
