<p><strong>Kidian</strong> (also known as <strong>Vulcanus</strong>) is the only known planet orbiting <strong>40 Eridani A</strong>, where humanity established one of its first <i>Exodus Colonies</i> in 2398. However it is believed that they were preceded by the lost <i>Children of Kastiel</i> decades earlier. The discovery of the ArcWays led to the arrival of the second major colony in 2831, renewing direct contact with Earth after centuries of isolation</p>
