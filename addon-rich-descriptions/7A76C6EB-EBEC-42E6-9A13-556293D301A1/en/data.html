<p><strong>Telstar 1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> were among the first communications satellites ever launched. Designed and operated by NASA, they allowed the first live television broadcast between the United States and Europe. Both satellites were sent into highly elliptical orbits in 1962 and 1963, where they remain to this day, though they operated for only 7 and 24 months, respectively.</p>
