<p><strong>IGR J12580+0134</strong> is the central supermassive black hole within the galaxy <strong>NGC 4845</strong>. Located nearly 68.7 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo, it is estimated to be about 300,000 times the mass of the Sun. In 2013, the <a href="celaddon://item?item=1A1FEB05-A523-C17A-0E49-E0179AAC3051">INTEGRAL</a> satellite detected an X-ray flare corresponding to the black hole absorbing matter from a low-mass object, presumed to be a brown dwarf or superjovian planet. This makes it the first known exoplanet to orbit a black hole</p>
