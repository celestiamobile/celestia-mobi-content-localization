<p>This addon adds, as an alternative surface, a topographic map for the planet Venus, showing relief formations and surface elevations. Based on data obtained by the <a href="celaddon://item?item=64FA45B2-F62D-576D-6C74-23ED33C9F6C1">Magellan</a> orbiter.</p>
<p></p><aside class="aside-container important"><p class="label">Important</p><ul><li>Due to the large size of this alternative texture, Celestia may crash on some devices.</li><li>To see Venus's surface, remember to turn off atmospheres and clouds in Settings/Features.</li><li>Venus was mapped in detail only by the Magellan mission in the 1990s using synthetic-aperture radar. However, planetary coverage is not entirely perfect. Note that there will be some inconsistencies, holes and lack of data in some regions of the planet.</li></ul></aside><p></p><p><img class="full-width-image" src="{0}"><i class="text-secondary-size text-secondary-color">The two hemispheres of Venus</i></p>
