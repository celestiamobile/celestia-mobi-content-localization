<p>NASA's <strong>Dragonfly</strong> is a future space mission to send a robotic rotorcraft to fly above the surface of <a href="celaddon://item?item=723F28EB-E226-413C-96D9-FC901A3E4056">Titan</a>. Scheduled for launch sometime in July 2028, it is expected to arrive on Saturn's largest moon around 2034 about south of Selk Crater, which is 800 km north of <a href="celaddon://item?item=59AF2D3E-62EF-FDDB-A0F7-6980B7DCE265">Huygens</a>'s landing site. It will be the second extraterrestrial aircraft built after <a href="celaddon://item?item=9150B92D-67C6-8955-4955-8D6DA88AC9E9">Ingenuity</a></p>
<p>NOTES:<ul><li>Dragonfly is visible on Celestia starting 2034-Sept-10. Take note that the actual landing date is still unknown (as of 2024)</li><li>The rotorcraft's blades rotate at 60 rpm. They are understandably faster in real life, but specific details aren't yet publicized</li></ul></p>
