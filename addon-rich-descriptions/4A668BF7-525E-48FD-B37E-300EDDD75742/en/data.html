<p><strong>Beresheet</strong> was Israel's first lunar landing mission. Launched from a Falcon 9 in February 2019, it successfully entered lunar orbit on 4 April 2019. However, it crashed onto the lunar surface after suffering with gyroscopic failures during its landing attempt on 11 April 2019. A follow-up mission, <i>Beresheet-2</i>, was planned for flight by 2025 but was never funded.</p>
