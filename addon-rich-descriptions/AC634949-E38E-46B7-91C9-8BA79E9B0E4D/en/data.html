<p>The International Sun-Earth Explorers (ISEE) were a series of satellites designed to study the interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind. Three were launched between 1977 and 1978, where the last one (also known as the International Cometary Explorer or (ICE) is notable for being the first spacecraft to enter orbit around a Lagrange point and fly by a comet in 1985</p>
<p>NOTES:<ul><li>Both ISEE-1 and 2 can only be viewed in Celestia from 1977 to 1987</li><li>Only ISEE-3 (ICE) can be visited in the Present Day, albeit its name does not appear onscreen since 2014 to simulate it is now a derelict object in space</li><li>ISEE-3's orbit before 2014 is semifictional. This is due to lack of available surviving trajectory data necessary to accurately reconstruct its orbits since 1978</li></ul></p>
