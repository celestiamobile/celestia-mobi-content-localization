<p>The International Sun-Earth Explorers (ISEE) were a series of satellites designed to study the interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind. Three were launched between 1977 and 1978, where the last one (also known as the International Cometary Explorer or (ICE) is notable for being the first spacecraft to enter orbit around a Lagrange point and fly by a comet in 1985</p>
