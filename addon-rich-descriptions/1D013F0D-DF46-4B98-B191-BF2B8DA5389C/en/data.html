<p><strong>Mir</strong> is a Soviet/Russian space station that operated in LEO from 1986 to 2001. It is the first modular space station ever assembled in space, and throughout its history, it hosted 30 long-duration expeditions, each carrying three astronauts arriving via a Soyuz or a Space Shuttle, with stays ranging from 7 to 434 days. The experience acquired in space station assembly paved the way for other modular space stations like the <a href="celaddon://item?item=DB2CB6F5-247F-761C-4001-072A6C6BE5FD">ISS</a> and <a href="celaddon://item?item=BA5FBDDC-FEEA-F437-FC8E-1DF31AD6E4FB">Tiangong</a> to also be built.</p>
