<p><strong>55637 Uni</strong> (formerly known as <strong>2002 UX₂₅</strong>) is a 681-km wide classical Kuiper Belt object (cubewano) that has garnered scientific attention due to its very low density. It has only one known satellite, <strong>Tinia</strong>. In 2025, both objects were named after the Etruscan gods of love and the sky, respectively.</p>
