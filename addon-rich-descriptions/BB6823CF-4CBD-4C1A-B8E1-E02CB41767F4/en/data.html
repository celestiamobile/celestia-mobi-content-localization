<p>The <strong>Capsule Ariane Technologique (CAT)</strong> were a series of four test payloads that were launched from the first four flights of the Ariane 1 rocket. They were intended to record the performance of the Ariane 1, including instruments for vibration, acceleration, launch and sound environment. These satellites operated on battery power for at least six days, between 1979 and 1981</p>
