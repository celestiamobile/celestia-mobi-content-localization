<p><strong>Theia</strong> is a hypothetical planet the size of Mars that may have collided with Earth 4.5 billion years ago, giving rise to the Moon. It is estimated that before impact with Earth, Theia was at the L4 or L5 point of Earth's orbit, so due to Earth's continued growth, Theia was pushed out of L4 or L5. Possible gravitational perturbations from Venus may have sent Theia on a collision course with Earth</p>
