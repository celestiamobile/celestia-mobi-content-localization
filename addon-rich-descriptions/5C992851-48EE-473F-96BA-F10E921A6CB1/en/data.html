<p>This addon adds a high-resolution virtual texture (VT) for Triton, which replaces the default texture. Includes surface map (true color and enhanced colors), normal map and cloud map (with visible plumes!), created from imagery from the <a href="celaddon://item?item=7EC33280-6523-8F01-FB57-AB000C1000DB">Voyager 2</a> (Enhanced colors is an alternative texture).</p>
<p><img class="full-width-image" src="{0}"><i class="text-secondary-size text-secondary-color">Triton, in true and enhanced colors, respectively</i></p>
<p><img class="full-width-image" src="{1}"><i class="text-secondary-size text-secondary-color">Two plumes (Mahilani and Hili) in Triton's southern hemisphere, observed during Voyager 2's flyby in August 1989. They rise up to 8 km above the surface, and high-altitude winds create their trails</i></p>
