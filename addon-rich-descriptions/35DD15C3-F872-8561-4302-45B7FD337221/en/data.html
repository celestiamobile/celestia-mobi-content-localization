<p>The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) is a NASA/APL mission that successfully demonstrated the use of a kinetic impactor for planetary defense against near-Earth objects (NEOs) for the first time. It intentionally crashed onto a moon of asteroid 65803 Didymos called Dimorphos, which has reduced its orbital period around its host by 32 minutes on 2022-Sept-26.</p>
