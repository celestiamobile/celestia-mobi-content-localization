<p>The <strong>Van Allen Probes</strong>, also known as the <strong>Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP)</strong>, were two NASA robotic spacecraft designed to study the Earth's Van Allen radiation belts. Launched in 2012, they were placed in a highly elliptical orbit and operated for seven years until they were both decommissioned in 2019. They were expected to be naturally deorbited by 2034</p>
