<p>C/2024 S1 (ATLAS)Â was a sungrazer and probable Kreutz comet discovered on 2024-Sep-27. If it survived the intense heat and tidal forces of the Sun during perihelion in 2024-Oct-28, it could potentially become visible during the day, with an estimated magnitude between -5 and -7. However, just before perihelion, the comet's nucleus completely disintegrated, as observed by <a href="celaddon://item?item=8A89E168-D5A3-CF4E-EA06-8D0D97B1364C">SOHO</a>.</p>
