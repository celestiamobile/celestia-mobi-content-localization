<p>Rao is the name of the red dwarf (supergiant in other various media) where Superman's homeworld, the planet Krypton, is located. In the 2012 comic, Superman#14 "Star Light, Star Bright", both Kal-El and Neil deGrasse Tyson pinpointed that the nearby (real-life) star LHS 2520 is the exact same star system as Krypton and Rao was.</p>
