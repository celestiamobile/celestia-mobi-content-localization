<p><strong>Arrakis</strong> is the most important planet in Frank Herbert's <i>Dune</i>. A desert world orbiting the star, <strong>Canopus</strong>, it is the only known natural source of a substance known as <i>Melange (spice)</i>, where it was used for primarily for medicine and safe interstellar navigation across the galaxy. Paul Atreides later established this planet as the capital of his new empire.</p>
