<p>65803 Didymos is a near-Earth asteroid from the Apollo group, discovered in 1996 and with ~780 m in diameter. Its small moon, Dimorphos, with ~160 m in diameter, was the target of <a href="celaddon://item?item=35DD15C3-F872-8561-4302-45B7FD337221">NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)</a> mission in September 2022, which successfully demonstrated the use of kinetic impact for planetary defense. A subsequent mission, <a href="celaddon://item?item=7D0EE104-5066-4FA2-BAFF-56F27E48A2E9">ESA's Hera</a>, will arrive at the binary system in November 2026 to assess in detail the effects of the DART impact.</p>
