<p>The Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) was a NASA Earth observation satellite that launched from Space Shuttle Challenger on 1984-Oct-5. It was the first Shuttle-launched satellite to be placed directly onto space using the Canadarm, and it measured the planet's radiation budget and studied stratospheric aerosol and gases until its decommissioning in 2005. Afterwards, it remained derelict in LEO until it reentered the atmosphere over the Aleutian Islands on 2023-Jan-8</p>
