<p><strong>668956 (2012 PM₃₅)</strong>, also known as <strong>2020 OG₁₀₆</strong>, is a small main-belt asteroid that made a very close encounter with <a href="celaddon://item?item=20E27C97-EF70-A424-A05A-6743529A0946">Ceres</a> in 2017. It flew past the dwarf planet at a distance of 235,000 km (146,000 mi) which is sufficient enough that its gravity was able to slightly perturb the asteroid's orbit and was temporarily lost until 2020. With an absolute magnitude of 17.1, 2012 PM₃₅ is estimated to be around 0.9–2.3 km in diameter.</p>
