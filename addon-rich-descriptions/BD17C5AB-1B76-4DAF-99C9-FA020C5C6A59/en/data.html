<p>A fictional Cassini-type spacecraft launched in February 21, 2019 on a 27-year mission to reach the dwarf planet Eris on 2046.  It is the seventh of eight missions as part of the Toutatis Program (2018-2047), although chronologically it was the third launched (after <a href="celaddon://item?item=465867E5-59B4-2E54-E36C-F64D7FF6A64C">Toutatis-2</a>)</p>
