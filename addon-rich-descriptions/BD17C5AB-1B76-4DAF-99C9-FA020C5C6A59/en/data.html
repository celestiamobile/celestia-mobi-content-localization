<p>A fictional Cassini-type spacecraft launched in February 21, 2019 on a 27-year mission to reach the dwarf planet Eris on 2046.  It is the seventh of eight missions as part of the Toutatis Program (2018-2047), although chronologically it was the third launched (after <a href="celaddon://item?item=465867E5-59B4-2E54-E36C-F64D7FF6A64C">Toutatis-2</a>)</p>
<p>NOTES:<ul><li>There's a major trajectory discrepancy occurring at the time the spacecraft's reference frame transitions from the Sun to Eris on August 2046. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future</li><li>Optionally, you can install the <a href="celaddon://item?item=0F34A456-C3A1-2D02-D599-06AB5EABFD79">136199 Eris</a> addon for a more improved visual representation of the dwarf planet for this mission</li></ul></p>
