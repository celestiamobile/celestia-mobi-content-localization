<p>The <strong>Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS)</strong> is a NASA space mission with the objective of determining the nature of hydrogen detected in the polar regions of the Moon and also looking for the presence of water in the form of ice. LCROSS was launched together with the <a href="celaddon://item?item=875D166F-3E74-3C2A-0D69-35BAE4D59DE7">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> on 18 June 2009. Both LCROSS and its Centaur stage impacted the lunar south pole at Cabeus Crater on 9 October 2009. The plume generated by the mission helped confirm the existence of water ice on the Moon.</p>
