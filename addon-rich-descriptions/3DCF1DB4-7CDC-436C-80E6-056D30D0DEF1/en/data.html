<p>Halley's Comet (1P/Halley) is a famous periodic comet that is visible from Earth every 74 to 79 years. Known since the ancient times, its nature as a comet wasn't discovered until Sir Edmund Halley calculated its orbit in 1705. Its last perihelion occurred in 1986, and in that year it was visited by five spacecraft simultaneously (<a href="celaddon://item?item=4E7AD006-8874-6797-6307-CE0A9FC5EB42">Giotto</a>, Vega 1/2, <a href="celaddon://item?item=EC93C11E-94CD-4EFE-92E9-A3A40EE3B39F">Sakigake</a> and <a href="celaddon://item?item=8DEF4313-66C9-4C4A-82F4-98EDFEB3A1B7">Suisei</a>). Its next return won't occur until 2061.</p>
