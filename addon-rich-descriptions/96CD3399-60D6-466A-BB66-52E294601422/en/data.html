<p><strong>IMAGE</strong>, also known as <strong>Explorer 78</strong>, was a NASA satellite that studied the interactions of the Earth's magnetosphere with the solar wind. Launched on March 2000, it was active until December 2005 when all operations unexpectedly stopped. It was briefly found and reactivated in January 2018, before it became silent again later that August.</p>
