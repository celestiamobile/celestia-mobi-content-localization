<p>This add-on adds XYZV trajectories in the period 1957-2100 for the 8 known (as of 2026) irregular outer satellites of Neptune. These satellites undergo gravitational perturbations, primarily from the Sun, which change their respective orbital elements. With this add-on, they are precisely simulated, which is not possible with simple default Keplerian orbits.</p>
