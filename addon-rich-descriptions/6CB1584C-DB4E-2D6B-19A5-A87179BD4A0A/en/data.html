Arriving on the Red Planet at the same time as <a href="celaddon://item?item=4C6AE771-BE52-F255-216F-2B5E92030182">Mars Hope</a> and <a href="celaddon://item?item=9150B92D-67C6-8955-4955-8D6DA88AC9E9">Mars 2020</a>, it later successfully deployed and land the <strong>Zhurong</strong> rover on May 2021, making China the second country to send a rover on Mars. As of 2024, only the orbiter remains operational</p>
