<p><strong>Salyut 4</strong> was a Soviet space station in orbit from 1974 to 1977. It was visited by two crewed missions arriving in Soyuz spacecraft, with the second one lasted for 63 days, overlapping with the <a href="celaddon://item?item=A27E7094-A182-478B-86D9-F2829D5A03F5">ASTP</a> in 1975. Along with its ill-fated identical twin, Cosmos 557 in 1973, they were the fourth and sixth space stations launched as part of the Salyut series</p>
