<p>99942 Apophis is a 370-m potentially hazardous asteroid that caused a short period of concern in December 2004 when initial observations briefly indicated a probability up to 2.7% that it would hit Earth on 2029-Apr-13. Later observations ruled out this possibility and instead will fly past Earth about 31,700 km on that date. NASA's <a href="celaddon://item?item=94387FB3-F3D6-43A4-E32C-07ADCBEF9AB7">OSIRIS-APEX</a> mission will encounter Apophis shortly after its 2029 Earth flyby.</p>
