<p>2MASS J11193254-1137466, also known as TWA 42, is a planetary-mass binary consisting of two young L-type rogue planets or sub-brown dwarfs, about 86.1 light-years away in the constellation Crater. A single super-Earth-sized satellite may be orbiting the primary within its current "habitable zone", but its existence has yet to be fully confirmed.</p>
