<p><strong>Kepler-186</strong> is a red dwarf star about 582 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. It is orbited by five known rocky planets, although the existence of the fifth (a potentially habitable world) has not been fully verified in follow-up studies since 2019, but not ruled out entirely.</p>
