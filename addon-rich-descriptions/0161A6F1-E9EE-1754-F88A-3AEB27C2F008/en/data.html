<p><strong>367943 Duende (2012 DA₁₄)</strong> is a small Aten/Atira-class near-Earth asteroid about 47 meters in diameter. It made its closest approach to Earth on February 15, 2013 at a distance of 27,700 km. However its encounter was overshadowed when (by coincidence) an <a href="celaddon://item?item=7D87CEBE-DBF6-203B-0A4C-C771F369123A">unrelated meteor about half its size</a> exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia about 16 hours earlier.</p>
