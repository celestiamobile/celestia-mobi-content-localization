<p><strong>Landsat 6 and 7</strong> were the third-generation of NASA/USGS satellites dedicated in imaging the Earth's surface. Landsat 6 was destroyed after its launch in 1993, while Landsat 7 operated for 26 years between 1999 and 2025, after providing up-to-date and cloud-free images of the Earth for mapping and remote sensing. They are both replaced with <a href="celaddon://item?item=29A2623B-A41D-64AB-6465-41E162DF98D9">Landsat 8 and 9</a></p>
