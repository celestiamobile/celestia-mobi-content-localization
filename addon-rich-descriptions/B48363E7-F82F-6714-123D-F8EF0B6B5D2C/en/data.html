<p><strong>Fomalhaut</strong> is a triple star system consisting of an A-type and K-type main-sequence stars and a red dwarf about 25 light-years away in the constellation Pisces Austrinus. From 2008 to 2020, a <a href="celaddon://item?item=A514784B-ED88-2A10-BD2F-DE786C66C5F4">planet was suspected to be forming in the protoplanetary disk</a> surrounding the primary star of the system, until it was later determined it is just an expanding dense cloud of debris within the disk itself</p>
