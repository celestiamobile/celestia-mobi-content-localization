<p>The <strong>Lunar Orbiter</strong> program was a series of five uncrewed lunar missions launched by NASA from 1966 and 1967, that were intended to help select <a href="celaddon://item?item=B6929DF5-62CA-497B-B38D-651CC175177E">Apollo</a> landing sites by mapping the Moon's surface. They also provided the first photographs from lunar orbit and photographed both the Moon and Earth. All were successful, and are now intentionally deorbited at the end of their missions</p>
