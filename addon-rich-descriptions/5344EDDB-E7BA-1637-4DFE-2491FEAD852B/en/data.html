<p><strong>Mariner 10</strong> was the first spacecraft to visit Mercury. Launched in 1973, it used Venus's gravity to slow itself down and months later it flew by Mercury three times from 1974 to 1975. Due to low propellant, the spacecraft was decommissioned on 1975-Mar-24, shortly after the third Mercury flyby occurred</p>
